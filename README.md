I'm DXhello, a digital explorer and code tinkerer. I spend my time diving into the fascinating world of technology, playing with code, and building things that sometimes even work! 🚲💨

**About me:**

*   Passionate about all things tech and everything fun. 🤪
*   A firm believer that the best way to learn is by doing (and breaking things along the way). 💥
*   Currently on a quest to discover the ultimate coding setup. (Suggestions welcome!) ☕️
*   I have an imaginary pet unicorn that helps me debug. 🦄✨
*   I collect stars, not the celestial kind, but the digital ones. ⭐⭐⭐
